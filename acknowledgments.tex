\section{Acknowledgements}

The authors wish to thank Kostis Karantias for his valuable contributions with respect to
the design of the protocol that uses Merkle Mountain Ranges to build infix proofs on top
of velvet suffix proofs. We thank Tristan Nemoz and Alexei Zamyatin for fruitful discussions
on the FlyClient attacks.
